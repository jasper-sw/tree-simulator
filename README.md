# Vertex Tree Simulator
This is a fun project I created using pygame this last semester to help create vertex trees for my Discrete mathematics class. We had an assignment where we needed to sort all trees on 8 vertices into homeomorphism classes, and where we had to prove that the petersen graph was not planar using Kuratowski's Theorem as well as the Euler / DesCartes Equation. This involved creating a lot of different vertex trees as well as creating sub-graphs from vertex trees which was tedious to do by hand and hard to include in our LaTeX homework.

I created this tool to make the process easier and to allow us to easily produce digital images of our vertex trees. I was able to use this on my homework and even shared it in the class discord and a number of other students used it to create graphs for their homework too.

# Running the simulator
This can either be run in a python IDE of your choice, so long as you install pygame, or by using the executable located in the "executable" folder which I was able to create from the python file using a command line tool called PyInstaller.
